# Deployment

## Prerequisites

The website depends on the Sensor Server and Digital Hospital Server to be running. The details of running the digital hospital server can be found in the repository of the [digital hospital server](https://gitlab.developers.cam.ac.uk/ycc39/histo-des-server) (it is built by Yin-Chi)

## Eco System File

We use `pm2` to run the website and the sensor server in a production environment. The configuration file for `pm2` is `ecosystem.config.js`. This spins up both services and runs them on different ports in detached mode.

```js
const prodEnv = {
  WEB_PORT: 2222,
  SENSOR_PORT: 7777,
  DH_PORT: 5000, // Can not be configured on this file
};

const devEnv = {
  SENSOR_PORT: 8000,
  DH_PORT: 5000, // Can not be configured on this file
};
...
```

> Note: The `DH_PORT` is not configurable in this file. It is set in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the [digital hospital server](https://gitlab.developers.cam.ac.uk/ycc39/histo-des-server) repository.

The `devEnv` is used to set the ports for the sensor server when running in development mode. The website uses these ports in dev. Note you can not change the port that the website runs in development using this file. To do that you have to go into the `web` directory and run

```bash
PORT=<PORT> pnpm start
```

Use this to change the ports of the servers if you are running them on different ports.

## Pre Deployment

### `web`

Build the website by cd into the web directory and run

```bash {filename="/web/"}
pnpm build
```

### `servers/sensor`

Ensure you have a virtual environment set up using the folder name `venv`, it is important that the folder is called `venv` as the ecosystem file looks for this folder. Then install the packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

Also ensure the ETL folders are in the folder, these are not included in the git repo.

```bash {filename="/servers/sensor/"}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Ensure you have `pm2` installed globally

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

Then run

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

This will run the website and the sensor server in detached mode. You can view the logs of the services by running

```bash
pm2 logs
```

You can monitor the services by running

```bash
pm2 monit
```

## Stopping

To stop the services run

```bash
pm2 stop ecosystem.config.js
```

## Restarting

To restart the services run

```bash
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js
```

## Delete

To delete the services run

```bash
pm2 delete ecosystem.config.js
```
