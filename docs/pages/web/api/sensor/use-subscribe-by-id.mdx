# useSubscribeById

The `useSubscribeById` hook is a wrapper around the `useWebSocket` hook. This hook will subscribe to the device feed and filter the messages by the `acp_id`. It can take a list of `acp_id`s and will filter the messages by the `acp_id` of the device that sent the message.

## Parameters

- `id`: the `acp_id` of the device to subscribe to

## Returns

The hook returns the following:

- `messageHistory`: an array of all messages received from the server
- `lastMessage`: the last message received from the server
- `connectionStatus`: the current connection status

## Example Usage

```tsx
const { messageHistory, lastMessage, connectionStatus } = useSubscribeById(id);
```
