# Introduction

This directory contains the technical details for the digital twin website developed by Lakee Sivaraya.
Use the sidebar to navigate to the different sections of the documentation.

# Pre-requisites

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have them installed, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Tools

We are using the `Next.js` framework in Typescript to build the website (using Pages Router). It is imporant that you have a good understanding of how Next.js works. You can read the documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) (
important: make sure read the docs for the Pages Router and not the App Router).
