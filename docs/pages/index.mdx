# Introduction

This directory contains the technical details for the digital twin website developed by Lakee Sivaraya.
Use the sidebar to navigate to the different sections of the documentation.

### Note on TypeScript

The entire website is written in TypeScript. It is important that you have a good understanding of TypeScript. TypeScript is very strict and does not allow you to write sloppy code (like Python does), so it is important that you write proper, clean code with error checking as you go along or else TypeScript will complain. The amazing thing about TypeScript is that it basically makes it impossible to write bad code with bugs in it, so it is important that you take advantage of this. **It is very very important that you use an IDE with linting as without it you will not see the errors and warnings that TypeScript will throw at you until build time. I suggest using VSCode however if you use Vim or macs you can install a plugin to do the linting for you.**

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have them installed, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Tools

We are using the `Next.js` framework in Typescript to build the website (using Pages Router). It is imporant that you have a good understanding of how Next.js works. You can read the documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) (
important: make sure read the docs for the Pages Router and not the App Router).

The entire repository is a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) project. Turbo is a tool that allows you to build your website in a modular way. You can read more about Turbo [here](https://turbo.build/docs), it is important that you have a good understanding of how Turbo works. Turborepo allows us to cache our packages and builds our website faster.

Install the Turbo CLI by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g turbo
```

We also use the following tools:

- Tailwind CSS (Styling) - https://tailwindcss.com/
- Radix UI (Design System) - https://www.radix-ui.com/
- Tremor (Dashboard Components) - https://tremor.so/

<Callout type="info">

It is assumed that you have a good understanding of how these tools work particularly React using functional components and hooks.

## Running the website

You either run the website from the root directory or from the `web` directory.
