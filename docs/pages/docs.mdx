# Documentation website

The documentation website is built using [Nextra](nextra.site) and it will automaically be built and deployed to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch. You can see the built website on
`https://{username}.github.io/digital-twin/`

## Updating

The docs are written in Markdown and are located in the `docs` folder. You can edit them directly on GitHub or clone the repo and edit them locally. If you want to run the website locally, you should `cd` into the `docs` folder and run `pnpm dev`. This will start a local server and you can edit the docs and see the changes live.
