# Sensor Server

The sensor server has two purposes. It firstly takes all incoming MQTT messages from a WebSocket ETL and transforms them into a WebSocket message that is emitted to all clients. Secondly using a ETL for just HTTP, we can query the hisotrical data of the sensors and get the latest data for sensors. The server is built using FastAPI.

# WebSockets

## `/ws/`

> Note you need the trailing slash when connecting to the WebSocket server.

Returns feed of sensor data

```json
{
	"acp_id": "string",
	"acp_ts": "number",
	"payload": {...},
	"location": {
		"x": "number", // 0-100
		"y": "number" // 0-100
		"floor": "number" // 0 or 1
	}
}
```

**The locations are randomly generated and not based on the actual location of the sensor.**

## `/ws/{acp_str}`

Can filter by `acp_id`, can use a csv of `acp_id` to filter by multiple. eg

```
/ws/1,2,3
```

Wil return all messages from sensors with `acp_id` 1, 2 or 3.

# HTTP

## `GET` `/latest/`

Returns a list of all the latest sensor data from the devices (quering 2 days back)

## `POST` `/history/`

Req body

```json
{
  "acp_id": "string",
  "start_time": "string", // DD/MM/YYYY
  "end_time": "string" // DD/MM/YYYY
}
```

Gets the history of a sensor between two dates. Returns a list of all the sensor data between the two dates.
