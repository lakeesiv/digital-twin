import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
  It is imporant to note that it also hides a few config files, such as
  `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js`, which are used to configure ESLint and
  Prettier respectively, if you want to edit these files, you will need to
  unhide them in the settings.
