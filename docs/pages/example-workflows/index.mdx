# Preliminary

This section details some example workflows that go from fetching data, to plotting it and displaying it on a website.

**It is very much assumed that you have a working knowledge of React and TypeScript, as such basic stuff such as hooks (
`useState`, `useEffect`, etc
) will not be explained and also transforming data from one format to another will not be explained as this is basic JavaScript/TypeScript. CSS and HTML will also not be explained as this is very basic. Also the usage of React Components and JSX/TSX will not be explained since this is also basic React and is similar to HTML.**
