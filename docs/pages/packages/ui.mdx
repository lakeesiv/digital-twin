# UI

This folder contains reusable UI components that can be used in any project. These components are taken from
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with slight modifications. See the website for more information.

The UI is built and bundled using `tsup` this allows `Turborepo` to cache the build and only rebuild when necessary hence
when we use the `ui` package in other projects it will be fast.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="warning">
  It should be noted that if the build for `ui` fails then the build for the
  other projects will fail as well so only edit the `ui` package if you know
  what you are doing.
</Callout>
